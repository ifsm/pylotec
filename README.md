Pylotec can be used to calculate and visualize the mean spectra and mode shapes of your vibrometer measurement. 
It can currently only process transient datasets (in the time domain). 

Installation: 

1. Navigate to the folder where you saved the repo.
2. istall with <pip install .>
3. Use the Analyze.ipynb for loading the .uff file, calculating the impulse response functions, plotting the mean spectra and saving the mode shapes.
   All necessary function arguments are in this file. You might want to change them for a better fit to your data.
